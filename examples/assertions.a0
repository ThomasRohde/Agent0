# assertions.a0 — Demonstrate assert (fatal) vs check (non-fatal)
#
# assert halts execution on failure — use for invariants.
# check records evidence and continues — use for observations.
# If any check fails, the runner still returns exit 5.
# This example is configured to pass by default.

let data = { count: 42, items: [1, 2, 3] }
let count = get { in: data, path: "count" }

# Fatal: if this fails, execution stops immediately
let count_ok = eq { a: count, b: 42 }
assert { that: count_ok, msg: "count must be 42" }

# Non-fatal: records the result, program continues either way
let has_items = contains { in: data, value: "items" }
check { that: has_items, msg: "data has items field" }

let items = get { in: data, path: "items" }
let item_count = len { in: items }
let enough = item_count >= 3
check { that: enough, msg: "has at least 3 items" }

# Program completes with all evidence passing
return { ok: true, count: count, items: item_count }
