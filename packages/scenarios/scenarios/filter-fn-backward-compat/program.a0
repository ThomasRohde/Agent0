# filter by: still works alongside filter fn:
let items = [
  { name: "Alice", active: true },
  { name: "Bob", active: false },
  { name: "Charlie", active: true }
]

# old form: filter by key
let by_key = filter { in: items, by: "active" }

# new form: filter by fn
fn isActive { item } {
  return { ok: item.active }
}
let by_fn = filter { in: items, fn: "isActive" }

# both should give the same result
let same = eq { a: by_key, b: by_fn }

return { by_key: by_key, by_fn: by_fn, same: same }
